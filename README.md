# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis-

It has become an important issue for modern companies to better understand the needs of customers, to predict their behavior, to identify the differences and similarities between 
customers. For this reason, there was a need to segment the loyalty and profiles of customers. At this point, RFM Analysis comes into play, segmenting the customer profile with 
the criteria of recency, frequency and monetary. Python does this segmentation process with the help of convenient modules and helps companies to provide an institutional 
perspective to determine customer profile. Python modules used in the study: pandas , numpy , datetime, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn and os.
